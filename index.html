    <p>You should all try my delicious salmon cookies.  They don't taste fishy at all!  They have salmon in them, so they are good for you.  But they aren't fishy.  Who would want cookies that taste like fish?  Nobody!  So they don't taste like fish.  Come to one of our stores that absolutely do not smell like fish and try one of our non-fishy salmon cookies today!</p>
